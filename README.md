## Introduction
### General Introduction
League of Legends (LOL) is a popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Riot Games. With millions of players worldwide, it has become one of the most influential and widely played esports in the gaming industry. The data set we will be working with is a professional data set thatâ€™s developed by Oracle's Elixir. The file records match data from professional LOL esports gaming matches throughout 2022. 

This dataset captures key gameplay statistics and outcomes from a collection of LOL matches, offering a rich source of information for understanding player behavior, team dynamics, and match outcomes. It includes a variety of features such as individual player performance, team strategies, in-game statistics, and overall match dynamics.

In the realm of League of Legends (LOL), the concept of **"first blood"** holds significant weight and serves as an important trajectory of a match. First blood refers to the initial first kill secured by a team during the early stages of a game. Beyond its immediate impact on the scoreboard, first blood sets the tone for the ensuing gameplay, often shaping the general dynamics, strategies, and outcomes of the match.

The central question we are interested in is **Does the occurrence of the first blood influence the probability of winning a League of Legends match?** We want to use data analysis techniques to testify the impact of first blood on gaming statistics,  including individual player performance, team strategies, in-game metrics, and ultimately, match outcomes.
